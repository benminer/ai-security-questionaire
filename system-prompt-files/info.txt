Scope3, the collaborative sustainability platform decarbonizing media and advertising, is led by recognized industry experts in sustainable media who have advanced the development of a robust emissions model and open source methodology that rigorously applies the GHG protocol to the complex realm of digital advertising. Selected personnel of note include:

Brian O'Kelley, CEO and co-founder, is a respected entrepreneur and executive with a track record of building companies that defined and led multi-billion dollar categories. Credited with the invention of programmatic advertising and the online ad exchange, Brian is deeply committed to technology-driven innovations that benefit society while improving the health of the planet. 

Anne Coghlan, COO & co-founder, was responsible for the strategy and commercialization of the the industry’s first programmable DSP as product and strategy lead at AppNexus. At Scope3, Anne combines her passion for the planet with her expertise in building world-class products for the ad industry. 

Gabriella Kay, Head of Product, Creative & Production, brings comparable wealth of knowledge pertaining to creative production having joined Scope3 after co-founding Green The Bid, an organization committed to helping the production community tackle the collective goal of transitioning advertising production to sustainable and regenerative practices.
We are very young company and still working toward a full corporate sustainability report. Work that has been done to date includes measurement and reporting for all of our carbon emissions company wide. We have a dedicated workstream, "Walking the Walk," tasked with ensuring that our core business values are reflected in our day to day operation. 

Examples of our efforts in this area include: 
- Development and implementation of our Climate Conscious Travel Policy. The purpose of this policy is to provide more robust guidelines for all employees who travel for work, in order to ensure that we are focusing not only our company finances, but also on everyone’s health and safety, and our impact on the planet. The policy makes it clear that when travelling short distances that the train should always be used instead of flying. All travel needs to be logged so that it can be carbon compensated. Flying should be kept to an absolute minimum and all flights must be approved by management. Staff are instructed to opt for non stop flights where possible and for short to medium haul flights staff must book economy/coach class. 
- Scope3 is a fully remote company. We do not have any offices at all and everyone works from home. This means we save a lot of carbon from our scope 1 and 2. 
- Scope3 only serves vegetarian food at our industry and internal events. This is a deliberate decision to reduce carbon that comes from farming. 
Scope3 is releasing company GHG data in Q4 2024 at which time we will be happy to share with Duration Media for consideration. 
Work toward SBTi is in the planning phase. A key outcome that our “Walking the Walk” initiative aims to achieve is that Scope3 is an industry example of how to report on and reduce corporate emissions. Work on an SBTi commitment is included in our roadmap and we are happy to provide updates as this effort progresses. 
Since Scope3’s entire mission is to drive systemic decarbonization in media and advertising, we are centrally involved with industry leading organizations such as the ANA, WFA, AdNetZero, IAB, etc to help evangelize, standardize and contextualize both the impact our industry has in contributing to carbon emissions as well as the opportunity to ignite change. 

Scope3+GMSF+IAB+AdNetZero: Scope3 works on several working groups providing knowledge and sharing and contributing data to the industry bodies that are working to develop frameworks and standards in Carbon Emissions Measurement. 

WFA Planet Pledge Pilot Program: Scope3 partnered with the WFA and 6 global clients to understand how adding carbon as a campaign metric impacted performance. In all 5, we found removing high carbon inventory had a neutral to positive effect on performance! 

”I Cannes Remove Carbon” Scope3 Cannes-specific program in partnership with Carbon Direct. 

ANA Media Programmatic Media Supply Chain Transparency Report: Scope3 powers some of the data in this report. This report focuses on the costs in Programmatic and opportunities for efficiencies.
Scope3 provides emissions measurement to over 150 clients in a direct capacity. Through our partnerships with technology partners, Scope3 powered Green Media Products (GMPs) are used by over 3,500 brands.
Our client distribution is as follows: ad tech platforms (50%), advertisers (30%), publishers (20%).
